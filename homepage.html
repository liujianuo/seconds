    <h3>What is Seconds?</h3>
    <p>At Seconds?, our guiding question is: How might we reimagine food distribution centers for 
      Canadians in need of food in ways that increase sustainability, 
      accessibility, and community connection. Our central goals are achieving zero food waste and zero food insecurity, shaped by our values of sustainability, accessibility, and community connection.
      Seconds? is a service 
      that aims to connect businesses with an excess of food with living spaces that provide food to those in need. At its core, Seconds? is 
      a website and app that allows users to indicate their excess or need for food. What makes us
      distinct from other similar services is our algorithm for allocating food in ways that maximize 
      sustainability and effectiveness. We create a priority index for each living space that requires
      our donations to determine their need based on the number of people they service and their current 
      food supply. We also look at transport efficiency to calculate the most fuel-efficient routes to 
      deliver food to all businesses in need. Combined, this forms our food allocation algorithm.

    <h3>Facts and Figures</h3>
    <p>Seconds? targets two major problems: food insecurity and food wastage. These problems are present across Canada, but are exacerbated in major urban areas such as the GTA. 
    </p>
    <h4>Food Insecurity:</h4>
    <p>Almost one in five (18.6%) Torontonians lived in food-insecure households in 2021
      In 2022, the monthly cost of the NFB for a reference family of four is $1,141.
      The effects of the pandemic and inflation have led to an increase of people using food banks: 182,000 people in the GTA access food banks in 2023 compared to 60,000 before 2020.
      Risk of food insecurity increases for individuals who have disabilities, who live on a low income, who are racialized, who receive social assistance, and who are single parents.
    </p>
    <h4>Food Wastage:</h4>
    <p>Wholesale and retail sectors account for up to 72 per cent of the food waste ending up in landfills every year.
      1.1 million tonnes of food waste are created annually by the industrial, commercial, and institutional (IC&I) sector in Canada.
